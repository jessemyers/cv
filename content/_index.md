# Jesse Myers

I build software systems, architectures, and teams that work well together to create great products.
I believe that a great architecture serves the needs of people and helps them fulful the values of
their team; I believe that an architect must blend hands-on development -- in order to know these needs
-- servant leaderships, and deep technical expertise.

I am looking for an opportunity to exercise these talents in value-driven setting.
